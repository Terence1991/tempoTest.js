# tempoTest.js

# Getting started 

Install all dependencies using npm install.
Run the server by entering npm run start.


# Decisions I made 

I tried to timebox my effort into two hours as I understand this is the nature of the job and  I wanted to be transparent about my skills. There are somethings I could not get to with the time constraint but I thought I did well considering. Firstly I switched the server to express. For testing I used jest. The MVP that I managed to complete were the features I thought were the most important for the project. Unfortunately I could not give enough time for the comprehensive unit testing I wanted. Moreover it is something I need to dedicate my attention. We touched on it only a little at Light House Labs.

# What If I had more time.

I would of rebuilt the whole application using react and node.js. I have to admit I am not the biggest fan of jquery, but I understand certain projects demand working in a language or a framework which you might not be  the most comfortable with. I also would like to have spent more time making the UI nicer.
